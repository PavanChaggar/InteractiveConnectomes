Julia Pluto notebook for interactively exploring connectome data. 

## Setting up Julia 

First, download and install julia. You can do this by following instructions from [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#linux_and_freebsd). 

Depending on your system priviledges, you may need to set up an alias such as: 

`alias julia='/home/<username>/julia-1.5.3/bin/julia'`

If this has been installed correctly, starting a Julia REPL using `julia` should display version 1.5.3.
